This is a starting point for TypeScript solutions to the
["Build Your Own SQLite" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/sqlite).

In this challenge, you'll build a barebones SQLite implementation that supports
basic SQL queries like `SELECT`. Along the way we'll learn about
[SQLite's file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html), how indexed data
is
[stored in B-trees](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/10/02/how-does-sqlite-work-part-2-btrees/)
and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
